Hang ’em High
Personal Project - Hangman game

I decided to build out a Hangman game that a) didn’t require typing in letters to guess, b) would keep a running list of guessed letters the player could view, and c) used a JSON list of words.
Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JSON
